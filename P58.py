## Problem 58

## Starting with 1 and spiralling anticlockwise in the following way, 
## a square spiral with side length 7 is formed.

## 37 36 35 34 33 32 31
## 38 17 16 15 14 13 30
## 39 18  5  4  3 12 29
## 40 19  6  1  2 11 28
## 41 20  7  8  9 10 27
## 42 21 22 23 24 25 26
## 43 44 45 46 47 48 49

## It is interesting to note that the odd squares lie along the bottom right diagonal, 
## but what is more interesting is that 8 out of the 13 numbers lying along both 
## diagonals are prime; that is, a ratio of 8/13 â‰ˆ 62%.

## If one complete new layer is wrapped around the spiral above, 
## a square spiral with side length 9 will be formed. If this process is continued, 
## what is the side length of the square spiral for which the ratio of primes along 
## both diagonals first falls below 10%?
